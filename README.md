windows x64 only  

[FreeMote.Tlg](https://github.com/UlyssesWu/FreeMote.Tlg) is used to load tlg images  

----

unpack the xp3 archive that contains standing images before using this  

keep unpacked files in the original xp3 directory structure or put them all in the root directory should be both ok  
but the filename from the xp3 is somewhat important and must not be changed
